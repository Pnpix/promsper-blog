Promise Njoku is an emerging photographer who shows promise (no pun intended) in the world of fashion photography.
Based on a recent Instagram post, they seem to be skilled in creating edits for clothing brand campaigns. While there isn't a lot of information available online about Promise Njoku yet, their work with the clothing brand FLYGERIAN suggests an interest in capturing the style and energy of fashion.
It will be interesting to see what other creative projects Promise Njoku tackles in the future.
